## Angular / Java Ecommerce Application

This is an ecommerce app built from a class on Udemy. It is powered by a Spring Boot application on the backend (using a simple mysql database), and an angular application on the frontend.

The goal is to create a REST api using Spring to access data stored in the mysql database, primarily from the `products` table.

Then, angular will subscribe to this api to retrieve information about products, and ultimately create an ecommerce storefront for users to interact with CRUD actions on a shopping cart.
